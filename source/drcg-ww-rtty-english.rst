   For each completed QSO use the "Exchange Points Table" to obtain the
   QSO points. This table is available for download at www.drcg.de. 
   QSO-points on 40m  multiply by 2
   QSO-points on 80m  multiply by 3.

   Note: Longer distance QSOs will bring more points.

   (b) MULTIPLIERS: 
   All DXCC countries and all JA, W, VE and VK call areas (W1, W7, VK2, ..)
   count as multipliers on each band. Except JA, W, VE and VK main land
   do not count as multiplier.

   (c) SCORE: Total QSO-Points  x  Total-Multipliers 

8. LOGS: 
   All QSOs made during the contest must be included in the log, also if 
   participating in the SOAB6 class, but working more than the allowed
   time in the contest. In this case all QSOs in excess of the allowed
   operating time do not count towards your score, and will be used as
   a CHECKLOG. 
   (a) Only CABRILLO Logs will be accepted.
   (b) The Contest Committee requires an electronic log. Logs must be 
       sent as an e-mail attachment named "callsign.log". The e-mail 
       subject header must include the callsign used in the contest.

   (e) Logs where more than 15 % of the claimed QSOs have been removed as
       a result of log checking will be classified as checklogs.
